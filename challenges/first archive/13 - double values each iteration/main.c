CHALLENGE:
Create a program that calculates and, in the end, presents the total number 
of wheat grains that can be obtained on a chessboard, following the following 
rule: place one grain of wheat on the first square and, in the subsequent 
squares, double the grains from the previous square. In other words, on 
the first square, place 1 grain, on the second square, place 2 grains 
(totaling 3 grains at this point), on the third square, place 4 grains 
(totaling 7 grains at this point), on the fourth square, place 8 grains 
(totaling 15 grains at this point), and so on until reaching 
the sixty-third (64th) square. Use real variables as accumulators.
